**A) Context:**
```
- Objective:
  Identify groups of countries potentially interesting for exporting agri-food products.
  Database Used: FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization.
- Role:
  Data Analyst responsible for market segmentation.
```
**B) Methodologies:**
```
1. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA):
Visualization with a dendrogram to observe natural groupings.

2. K-means:
Analysis of centroids to interpret clusters.
Comparison with HCA.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Dimensionality reduction to visualize clusters and understand variable contributions.
```
**C) Results**
```
1. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA)
Dendrogram:
- Presentation of the hierarchy of groups.
- Identification of the optimal number of clusters.
- Interpretation:description of the main clusters identified.

2. K-means
- Centroids: analysis of the average characteristics of each cluster (e.g., level of political stability, food consumption per capita, etc.).
- Maps and Visualizations: projection of clusters on a PCA plot.
- Comparison with HCA:similarities and differences in results.

3. Visualization with PCA
Interactive graphs to explore clusters and relationships between variables.
```
**D) Recommendations:**
```
- Priority Cluster:
  Identification of groups of countries with the highest potential (e.g., moderate political stability, high food demand).

- In-Depth Strategy:
  Further study of promising clusters using a PESTEL analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal).
```

**E) Key skills**
```
- Data Science:
  Data cleaning and exploration.

- Clustering algorithms (HCA, K-means).
  Data visualization with PCA and dendrograms.

- Strategic Analysis:
  Interpretation of results for commercial decision-making.
```
**F) Tools Mastered:**
```
  Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
```
