A) Context:

Objective: Identify groups of countries potentially interesting for exporting agri-food products.
Database Used: FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization.
Role:

Data Analyst responsible for market segmentation.

B) Methodologies Used:

1. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA):
Visualization with a dendrogram to observe natural groupings.

2. K-means:
Analysis of centroids to interpret clusters.
Comparison with HCA.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Dimensionality reduction to visualize clusters and understand variable contributions.

C) Results

1. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA)
Dendrogram:
Presentation of the hierarchy of groups.
Identification of the optimal number of clusters.
Interpretation:
Description of the main clusters identified.

2. K-means
Centroids:
Analysis of the average characteristics of each cluster (e.g., level of political stability, food consumption per capita, etc.).
Maps and Visualizations:
Projection of clusters on a PCA plot.
Comparison with HCA:
Similarities and differences in results.

3. Visualization with PCA
Interactive graphs to explore clusters and relationships between variables.

Recommendations:

Priority Cluster:
Identification of groups of countries with the highest potential (e.g., moderate political stability, high food demand).

In-Depth Strategy:
Further study of promising clusters using a PESTEL analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal).

D) Key Skills Demonstrated

Data Science:

Data cleaning and exploration.

Clustering algorithms (HCA, K-means).

Data visualization with PCA and dendrograms.

Strategic Analysis:

Interpretation of results for commercial decision-making.

E) Tools Mastered:

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
